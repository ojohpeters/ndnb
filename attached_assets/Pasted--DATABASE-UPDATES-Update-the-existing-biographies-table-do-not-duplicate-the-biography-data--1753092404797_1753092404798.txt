 DATABASE UPDATES

Update the existing biographies table (do not duplicate the biography data):

    Change the status column to:

enum(
  'draft',
  'submitted',
  'needs_redraft',
  'editor_approved',
  'copyeditor_approved',
  'eic_approved',
  'returned_to_editor',
  'published',
  'declined'
)

Add these new nullable columns:

    editor_id (unsignedBigInteger)
    copy_editor_id (unsignedBigInteger)
    editor_in_chief_id (unsignedBigInteger)
    editor_notes (text)
    copyeditor_notes (text)
    eic_notes (text)
    decline_reason (text)

    Use a Laravel migration to apply this schema change.

âœ… CONTRIBUTOR UI LOGIC

At the bottom of the biography submission/edit form, add 3 responsive buttons:

[ Save ]    [ Preview ]    [ Submit ]

    Save: saves with status = draft

    Preview: opens the formatted biography

    Submit: sets status = submitted, and sets submitted_at = now()

âœ… EDITOR UI (Editors Approval Dashboard - EAD)

Show all biographies where status = submitted or status = needs_redraft.

For each biography, display responsive buttons:

[ Preview ] [ Edit ] [ Approve ] [ Redraft ] [ Decline ]

    Approve â†’ sets status = editor_approved, editor_id = auth()->id()

    Redraft â†’ sets status = needs_redraft and stores editor_notes

    Decline â†’ sets status = declined and saves decline_reason

âœ… COPY EDITOR UI (Copy Editors Dashboard - CED)

Show all biographies where status = editor_approved.

Actions:

[ Preview ] [ Edit ] [ Approve ]

    Approve â†’ status = copyeditor_approved, copy_editor_id = auth()->id()

âœ… EDITOR-IN-CHIEF UI (EIC Dashboard)

Show all biographies where status = copyeditor_approved.

Actions:

[ Preview ] [ Edit ] [ Approve ] [ Publish ] [ Return ] [ Decline ]

    Approve â†’ status = eic_approved, stores editor_in_chief_id

    Publish â†’ status = published, published_at = now()

    Return â†’ status = returned_to_editor, sets eic_notes

    Decline â†’ same as above, sets decline_reason

ðŸ“± RESPONSIVENESS

    Make all action buttons stack vertically on small screens (sm: breakpoints in Tailwind)

    Use card layouts or responsive table for dashboards

    Consider using color-coded tags for status badges (badge-success, badge-warning, etc)

ðŸ“« OPTIONAL (If Time Permits)

    Add flash notifications to contributors when their work is:

        sent back for redraft

        approved

        declined

        published

    Use Inertia flash messages and send them on controller redirects.
